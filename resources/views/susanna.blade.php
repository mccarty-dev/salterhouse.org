        <h2>Susanna Madora Salter</h2>

        <p>
            Born Susanna Madora Kinsey on March 2, 1860 in Belmont County, Ohio,
            Susanna would go on to make history in a small Kansas town less than thirty years later.

        <p>
            After settling in Argonia, KS, Susanna became active in the Women's Christian Temperance Union as well
            as the Prohibition Party. Her family was also involved in the town's politics. Her father
            was elected the first mayor of the town, elected just two years earlier and her husband had been the town's first
            clerk.

    <p>
        In 1887, afraid of the influence women's organizations and activists were gaining, some of men of Argonia got together
        and decided that nominating a woman would lead to a embarrassing loss in the upcoming mayoral election.
        They hoped it would discourage the women of the town from being more active in politics and dissuade them from
        putting forth their own candidates in future elections.
    </p>

    <p>
            The local Women's Christian Temperance Union, after discovering that Susanna was on the ballot, abandoned
            the candidate they had been supporting and voted for her en masse. She also gained the support of the minority
            party.
    </p>
        <p>
            Susanna received 2/3â€™s of the vote and became the first woman to be elected town mayor on April 4, 1887.
            She also became the first woman vote in to any political office in the United States.
            She served out a one year term and did not seek reelection.

        </p>

            Mrs. Salter lived over 100 years and died on March 17, 1961 in Norman, Oklahoma. She rests alongside her husband,
            Lewis A. Salter in the Argonia Cemetery. The town of Argonia named a park after her in her honor.
